# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard Portfolio Project

This repository contains a data analysis and visualization portfolio project based on a coffee shop's sales dataset. The objective was to clean the transactional data, build an interactive dashboard to display key metrics, and summarize findings in a concise Q&A report.

## Project Overview

- Cleaned the `CoffeeShop.xlsx` dataset by handling missing values, standardizing categorical labels, and parsing date/time fields.
- Used pivot tables and visualizations to explore sales patterns across hours, weekdays, months, locations, and product categories.
- Built a dashboard to present key performance indicators (total revenue, customer footfall, average bill per person, average orders per person) and highlight top-performing products and categories.
- Summarized the insights and recommendations in a report to practice documentation skills.

The dashboard conveys total revenue, footfall, average bill, and orders per person, along with breakdowns by hour, weekday, month, store location, product category, and size distribution.

## Learning Process

This project served as a hands-on exercise in:

- Data cleaning and transformation in Excel.
- Creating pivot tables and charts to extract insights.
- Designing an effective dashboard to tell a data story.
- Writing a Q&A-style report to document findings.
- Managing a portfolio project end-to-end and publishing it on GitHub.
