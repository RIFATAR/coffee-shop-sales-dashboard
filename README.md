This repository contains a data analysis and visualization portfolio project based on a coffee shop's sales dataset. The objective was to clean the transactional data, build an interactive dashboard to display key metrics, and summarize findings in a concise Q&A report.

## Project Overview

- Cleaned the `coffeeShop.xlsx` dataset by handling missing values, standardizing categorical labels, and parsing date/time fields.
- Used pivot tables and visualizations to explore sales patterns across hours, weekdays, months, locations, and product categories.
- Built a dashboard to present key performance indicators (total revenue, customer footfall, average bill per person, average orders per person) and highlight top‑performing products and categories.
- Summarized the insights and recommendations in a report to practice documentation skills.

## Dashboard Snapshot
